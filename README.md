#### WIP REPOSITORY – CODE IS PRESENTED “AS IS”. Please refer to the [roadmap](https://discreet.net/roadmap) for progress.

For more information about this project go to https://discreet.net or send us an e-mail, also found on the website.

This is the main repository for the Discreet Network. This project interfaces with the [DiscreetCore library](https://github.com/DiscreetNetwork/DiscreetCore-Win) to perform the necessary cryptographic operations required for the Discreet protocol.

For a cross-platform graphical user interface you can review the [discreet-gui](https://github.com/DiscreetNetwork/discreet-gui) repository.

Documentation on building this repository for multiple platforms, interacting with the dæmon through the API will soon be added to the [main Discreet website](https://discreet.net/roadmap).
